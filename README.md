# Accessibility information cards
Free accessibility information cards to help you make your content accessible. Each card has several steps, and includes background information explaining its relevance. The accessibility principles when followed together will make video, forms or a chatbot UI accessible up to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2) AA.

Each card has a companion webpage which includes optional collapsed background information explaining why the guideline is relevant, and provides additional helpful information along with the WCAG 2 guidelines.
